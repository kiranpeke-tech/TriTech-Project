# TriTech-Project
An AI-based preventive solution to detect and warn users about potential image misuse before sharing, promoting ethical and responsible AI usage.
SafeLens AI
SafeLens AI is an AI-powered preventive solution designed to address the growing misuse of images through unethical AI technologies.
With the rise of generative AI tools, personal images can be manipulated, misused, or shared without consent. Existing solutions often respond after harm has occurred. SafeLens AI focuses on prevention rather than reaction.
The system analyzes images before they are shared and alerts users if potential misuse risks are detected. This enables users to make informed and responsible decisions, promoting ethical AI usage and digital safety.

Key Objectives:
Prevent AI-based image misuse before sharing.
Promote ethical and responsible AI practices.
Raise awareness about digital privacy and consent.
Provide a user-friendly and transparent safety mechanism.

Proposed Features:
Image safety analysis using AI.
Risk detection and warning alerts.
Simple and intuitive user interface.
Preventive approach to content misuse.

Future Scope:
Integration with social media platforms.
Automatic blurring of misused content.
Community-based reporting system.
Platform-level accountability mechanisms.
